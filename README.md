Open-Source Software for the Multiscale Modeling of Combined Antisolvent and Cooling Crystallization in Turbulent Flow Using OpenFOAM

The software implements a multiscale model, capable of predicting macro to micro-mixing scales, as well as the full crystal size distribution (CSD) and energy conservation, including non-ideal mixing rules.
The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation with variable properties is coupled with a three-environment presumed probability density function (PDF) micro-mixing model, the spatially varying population balance equation semi-discretized using a high-resolution finite-volume method, and energy balance and scalar transport equations.
